<h3> my light </h2>
</div>
<p>
your light shines brightly on me 
<br> 
reflecting a comfy shelter
<br>  
as your light brings joy to others
<br>  
without even knowing so 
<br> 
<br>
are you there my firefly? 
<br> 
gloomy nights are spent without you 
<br> 
i’m sorry for being a knight 
<br> 
your safety matters to me 
<br>
<br> 
my sunshine, didn’t you know?
<br> 
you are exquisite in my eyes 
<br> 
people say “the eyes never lie” 
<br> 
for it reflects on your soul 
<br>
<br> 
my firefly, forgive me
<br> 
for being naïve and stubborn 
<br> 
as I close my eyes and whisper 
<br> 
i love you from the stars and back 
<br>

<h3> flower </h2>
</div>
<p>
for you know who I’m referring to
<br> 
ray of light that brightens my day
<br> 
your simper is as bright as Sirius
<br> 
a precious smile that’ll never fade
<br> 
<br> 
my dearest sunflower, my sunshine
<br> 
in my sad days, you cheer me up
<br> 
you bring color to my gloomy world
<br> 
and you make sure everything’s fine
<br> 
<br> 
bloom vibrantly amidst the devoid
<br> 
even when mass destruction hits you
<br> 
you stood tall with your vibrant color
<br> 
and I, have never felt this proud
<br> 
<br> 
so my everlasting ray of joy
<br> 
 you whose rays touch my fragile heart
 <br> 
beam your smile at me, don’t let it fade
<br> 
because I, will always love your smile

<h3> stars </h2>
</div>
<p>
they twinkle earning the hearts of others
<br>
loved by many, delighting others
<br> 
wished by a few for its true beauty
<br> 
a light incomparable to others
<br> 
<br> 
i look in the sky and see it twinkle
<br> 
gaining my utmost curiosity
<br> 
and gaining my utmost attention
<br> 
not knowing my heart is falling for her
<br> 
<br> 
they once said that we should not trust our hearts
<br> 
for it falls too much, it falls too deep
<br> 
but love risks, love thrives , love understands
<br> 
most of all, it shelters another heart
